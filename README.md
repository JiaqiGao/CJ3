####Notes
Nov 1st:
- I created a file on a detailed tentative schedule to follow. A prettier version can also be found on [DESIGN] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uwDqgV-XZSSHI1XbjVz9VHeNUHYq7YrTqNlwAMHkLxY/edit)  Whenever any of you complete something, let me know on messenger and I can help with the merging process with other files created by other members of the team
