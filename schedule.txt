Tues Nov 1
   Class: Continue with the workplan created the day before (c+pasted below). Make sure all necessary files have been created (even if they're empty). Plan out how stories are being stored (is each story getting its own database or are we modifying our database schema to include a column for story id?)
   Homework:
     * Jordan: Create new story--just text of the story (create.html)
     * Chloe: Basic login/registration (app.py, home.html, register.html,  login.html)
     * James: Ability to contribute to existing story (update.html, you reach this file by redirecting from a button from home.html). Start creating HTML files with Jinja templates.

Wed Nov 2
   Class: Ensure site redirects properly from register/login -> homepage -> read story -> create story/contribute story (connect the files)
   Homework:
     Fix anything buggy from previous assignments
     * Jordan: Start to add addition info to database when users create a new story (i.e. author id, author, last_update count, see DESIGN) and when users contribute to existing stories
     * Chloe: Add sessions to save user login data, add a logout button
     * James: Adjust code such that contribute ability only applies if user is logged in.
